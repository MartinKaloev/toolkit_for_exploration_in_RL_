# toolkit_for_exploration_in_RL_
this is supporting toolking for the paper : Experiments Focused on Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning with doi: DOI: 10.1109/ISMSIT52890.2021.9604690


This toolkit is create to ease experiments with RL-exploration
options:
1. Optional test described in the paper
1.1. no restictricted exploration
1.2. randomized explorarion
1.3. artificial restrictions
1.4 lead by teacher explorations
2. options for custom size ANN
3. options for custom sized buffer replay
4. options for build in plots (visualizations of results)
5. option for choosing size of training episodes and test episodes
6. option for overestemation checking (described in the paper)

BONUS: REALtime checking how advantage changes weights of the ANNs during training

If this toolkit may be usefull for you, used!!!!
Citation of the paper will be much apriciated, 
Have a nice day dear reader.
